Hey all, I’m making a dual colored g/w midrange deck. And I was wondering why decks don’t use more than 8 of the dual colored lands when clearly a ton more are legal? Is their a hidden rule against more than 8 or is it for a strategic reason. What does CIPT stand for? CIPT abbreviation. Define CIPT at AcronymFinder.com. Printer friendly. Menu Search.

Why exactly is the mana base so bad? I see complaint after complaint but not really an explanation as to WHY it is so bad. If they put the mana base everyone wanted, what would have been left to even put in the deck?

Hello, I have been playing edh for a while now but I never ventured beyond 3 colors. I am currently in the process of putting together a Horde of Notions deck. Is it necessary for me to drop 500$ on shocklands/fetchlands/shadowmoor lands in order for the deck to work properly? I mean sure, IF I had them, the deck would function better, but can a 5-color edh deck work relatively well with checklands and stuff like chromatic lanterns/signets? Thanks.

I humbly come before you asking for help tuning my Esper list for FRF. Obviously no major events have occurred since the spoilers and today's release but I want to be ahead of the game. I have a few ideas for cards that might have a large impact on the list but I was wondering if any fellow control players had any thoughts on what cards might make a splash. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/23-01-15-NJF-esper-control/.

There has been a lot of discussion lately on mana bases of wedge-trios, Abzan and Jeskai in particular. They're yundoubtedly worse than Shard mana bases, because of how fetch lands interact with BFZ duals, but some of the best creatures and strategies are in wedge colors. I've done some testing over the last couple of days and I found Abzan to be pretty explosive, but often hindered by my mana base. Black mana in particular is hard to come by from sources that don't damage myself or don't. CIPT, New Delhi, India. 6,653 likes · 3 talking about this · 5 were here. CIPT is a not for profit organisation which is working towards research. 642-444 CIPT Cisco IP Telephony(CIPT) Online Certification Video Learning So I stumbled across Mirrodin's Core today and am a bit intrigued at its EDH potential. It does not enter the battlefield tapped so it can give you 1 colorless mana right away. And if you don't use it the turn you put it into play you can "charge" it with a colored mana. And, there is no limit to the charge counters you can have on this. Honestly, I think I might like Mirrodin's Core better than a Vivid land. As a budget option, I'm gonna give it a try in a 2 color deck. Thoughts? Comments. 
This exam tests learners for implementing a Cisco Unified Collaboration solution in a single-site environment. Ive been working on this deck for a long time now, and while its running pretty good, anyone got any advice for how to make it better? link; http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/karador-21-03-13-1/. When all the conductivity measurements are completed for both directions of the magnetic field, the resulting resistance measurements are fed into the CIPT model together with the probe positions. I want to try an aggro build of BG. I think the format will shift to aggro based on the new dual lands favoring aggro strategies. having come into play tapped lands late hurts slower strategies and I want to take advantage. BG was chosen because the creatures get big on their own instead of relying on cards to pump them to get over the hump.

Hey folks! I've been playing EDH for about 6 months now, after playing Magic for about 15 years off and on. So far I've focused on building durdly, janky, or budget decks. Not terrible, but also not competitive by most standards. Examples include: • Zedruu group hug without any explicit win conditions • Intet with only ramp, card draw, and 8+ CMC spells • Non-combo Karador with value ETB creatures. After getting my butt handed to me five games in a row a few weeks ago, I decided. Учебный центр Микротест проводит обучающий курс IP-телефония в сетях Cisco, часть II (CIPT_2) Cisco - приглашаем всех заинтересованных принять участие. I've just begun to play EDH and I'm learning the basics (and the fun!) of the game thus far. My only problem has been making a solid mana base for my decks. I bought a couple of pre-cons last year and played around with them to make better decks. What I found was the having lands not come into play tapped was such a huge advantage in multiplayer games. However, having a 3+ color deck, it's nearly impossible to have a solid mana base without a significant number of CIPT lands. Now, I'm buildin. CIPTech combines CIPT with CAPRES proprietary nano-MEMS probing technology,  CAPRES' CIPTech-M300 include all the unique features of our microRSP technology, a unique technology for measuring the sheet resistance of conducting films. I want to take CIPT certification and I am looking for any course material (paid or free) on the internet (preferably videos). Any help would be appreciated. The CIPT 2 day training course shows you've got the knowledge to build your organization's data protection structures from the ground. I'm rather new to MTG (playing for a couple months) and hear all these crazy deck descriptions like Midrange-Aggro and Weenie White but I have no clue what mine would be called. It's a White-Green-Splash Blue that uses lifegain to pump creatures. Check it out below, let me know your thoughts and how I can improve it as I am still learning. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/05-12-14-life-gain-pump/.

I see no point in waiting to talk about draft impressions for this set, since it's been spoiled for a few days and games are constantly firing on Cockatrice. Here are a few of my observations after doing a handful of drafts: 1. Creature swarms and weenie strategies are real. Your deck needs ways to combat or subvert these fast decks. Cards like Nausea are surprisingly powerful with all the X/1's running around. 2. 3+ color decks are real. The set of 10 common fixing lands means

I've always made the preference in draft for the common lands as they give both colours of mana, whereas a fetchland might give 2 options of colour but ends up only giving you one. Then one of the draft walk throughs at Worlds i think i heard the new word champion say he prefered fetches. Any thoughts? Note: We redraft rares so money isn't an issue.
