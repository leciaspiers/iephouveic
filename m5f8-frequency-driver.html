So whether your facility is a grand opera house or a local high school, you can trust us to give you the theatre equipment that meets your unique artistic, technical, and budget needs. I have added a custom kernel from third party repo for my distro, and have noticed that for my skylake processor, intel_pstate isn't being used. I realize it's meant to be enabled by default, tried adding kernel param `intel_pstate=enable` to use it but no luck. Side note, on the 4.16 kernel I have which does have intel_pstate by default, it seems to scale/report frequences up to 3.6GHz(turbo), acpi-freq however only manages to max non turbo rate of 3.2GHz and min of 2.4GHz instead of 800MHz. I've got a circuit breadboarded for driving an ultrasonic transducer. The baseline design is outlined here ( with the circuit here ( The transducer acts like a series LC load. As is, the frequency can be manually adjusted to match the impedance of the transducer. I am looking to make the transducer. Forgive my poor vocabulary - I'm not sure whether what I am working on is a tweeter, driver, horn, or some combination of the three. I have a three-way Peavey 358-S speaker cabinet which does not have a functioning high frequency driver. There is just no sound that comes from it. I know that there is audio coming out of the cross-over, because when I connect a piezo tweeter in its place, it works. I'm not exactly sure which part I need to replace, or if there is some part that can be repaired. It seems like a lot of speaker cones feature a rounded spike in the middle of the cone (mostly lower frequency drivers). I'm just curious as to the physics of why it's present. Cheers. 
Specifically, I'm referring to two subwoofers in one physical cabinet, but each one will not share any enclosure airspace. For instance: I'm dreaming of an inexpensive subwoofer that could be run as a stereo pairs, to accompany other speakers (open baffle, satellites, etc) that do not specialize in bass. In my case, open baffle mids and highs. I want to build myself a horn subwoofer, and believe I can make one using a fairly inexpensive 8" driver that will be highly efficient and right I was given a pair of Technics SB-2840.(Pictured here: ) I was using them for a while but was going to college and didn't bring them along since they are so big. I'm back home now though. The problem is that the tweeter/high frequency driver doesn't appear to be working at all. So my question is this, would anyone know if these are any good and worth saving/repairing? If so how would I go about finding a new driver that is the right match for these old speakers? Vanatoo is releasing the Transparent One Encore (https://vanatoo.com/shop/speakers/transparent-one-encore/) in February 2019, and taking pre-orders now for 0 (0 off) until the end of November. The Transparent One Encore is an active-powered speaker with built-in DAC that has USB, optical and Bluetooth connectivity. It is a follow-up and replacement to their excellently reviewed Transparent One. I own the smaller sibling to this speaker called the Transparent Zero, and I love the sound. I'm a new owner of a 2013 JSW with the stock, non nav RCD 510 head unit, and non Fender audio system. The sound system sounds pretty bad and I am looking for experienced advice on this. Particularly the high frequency. VCDS can modify the frequency response of the head unit, is this correct? Have you had any experience with this? Looking to avoid adding an external amplifier if possible. Has anyone had success at least upgrading the high frequency drivers? Replacing the crossover. Since everything comes from a single vibrating membrane I wonder how so many high and low frequencies can be produced simultaneously. I was looking and Klipsch Center speaker to finish my surround setup. RP-404C vs RP-600C are both 2018 models that cost about the same where I live. One is taller and has two bigger low frequency driver and the other one is longer and has four smaller low frequency driver. See https://www.klipsch.com/products/rp-404c-center-channel-speaker#product-specs https://www.klipsch.com/products/rp-600c-center-channel-speaker#product-specs I cannot decide between those two. Will they both perform. Over a year ago I posted about my church's speakers having a strange high frequency drop out issue. After we thought we had it fixed, it is back. I'm here to seek some insight and maybe get pointed in the right direction on finding the root of the problem. Console: Yamaha M7CL Speakers: JBL VRX932LAP (3 arrays of 3) Digital Backbone: CobraNet with BSS London Architecture Originally built in 2009 Location: Western PA The short version (sorta) is, when I took over this position as the audio. 
Hi, First things first: I am not sure this sub is the bast place for this question, but couldn't find better. Please tell me if this does not belong here. ​ So I recently bought two magnat vector 77 cabinets for very very cheap. The problem is both tweeters (one each cabinet) don't work (they have an infinite resistance and coil is melted). Besides that, they work like a charm. ​ I would like to replace them. Being new in the HiFi/HC world, I have no idea what to replace them with. This was a radiogram I inherited from my grandfather, which I've been cleaning up. Has a lovely sound to it, even if it's a little bit soft and muffled, even with the treble control fully cranked. I need to check the speakers yet, it might be the higher frequency drivers have about had it, I don't know for sure. Here's the unit in question (https://i.imgur.com/svaoDAR.jpg) It has a slightly odd arrangement of front controls. Have a look (https://i.imgur.com/OlqVZDG.jpg) Tone controls.
